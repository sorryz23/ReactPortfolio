        Hello, and welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Cody Andrews. I have been into technology for many years now. I have always had a passion for it and decided to pursue a bachelors in Computer Science. I recently changed course and this has lead me to where I am today. I started a Fullstack Bootcamp and will continue to pursue my goal of becoming a web-designer.
